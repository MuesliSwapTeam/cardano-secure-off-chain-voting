          Confederation (Data Protection Act, DSG), every person has the right to protection of their privacy as well as
          protection against misuse of their personal data. The operators of these pages take the protection of your

          Analytics data processing is carried out by Google LLC. Google LLC and Google Ireland Limited are hereinafter
          referred to as Google. The statistics obtained enable us to improve our offer and make it more interesting for

          carried out via a user ID. If you have a Google user account, you can deactivate the cross-device analysis of
          your usage in the settings there under My data, Personal data. The legal basis for the use of Google Analytics
          is Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f DS-GVO. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics
          will not be merged with other data from Google. We would like to point out that on this website Google
          Analytics has been extended by the code _anonymizeIp(); to ensure anonymized collection of IP addresses. This
          means that IP addresses are processed in abbreviated form, which means that they cannot be linked to a
          specific person. If the data collected about you is related to a person, this is immediately excluded and the
          personal data is deleted immediately. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transferred to a
          Google server in the USA and shortened there. On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this
          information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity and
          providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage to the website operator. For the

          generated by the cookie about your use of this website is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA
          and stored there. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser,
          however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website. You
          can also prevent the collection of data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the website
          (including your IP address) to Google and the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing
          the browser plugin available at the following link: Disable Google Analytics. In addition, you can also
          prevent the use of Google Analytics by clicking on this link: Disable Google Analytics. This will save a
          so-called opt-out cookie on your data carrier, which prevents the processing of personal data by Google
          Analytics. Please note that if you delete all cookies on your terminal device, these opt-out cookies will also
          be deleted, i.e. you will have to set the opt-out cookies again if you wish to continue to prevent this form
          of data collection. The opt-out cookies are set per browser and computer/end device and must therefore be
          activated separately for each browser, computer or other end device.
